      <h2>Transcript</h2>
      <p><strong>Voiceover:</strong> [Background music] Hi, everyone. Welcome to the News Visualisation Lab. Today our podcast will focus on the relationship between traditional media and visualisation trends. We welcome News Agency journalist Zou to join us.</p>
      <p><strong>Zou:</strong> Hi, thanks for inviting me.</p>
      <p><strong>Voiceover:</strong> So, let’s kick things off. What I’ve always been curious about is what traditional media thinks about visual journalism. Is it a competitor or a great opportunity for change?</p>
      <p><strong>Zou:</strong> Well, as a traditional journalist in the digital age, I’ve got some mixed feelings about this whole craze. On one hand, visualisation, with all its fancy multimedia stuff, like images, videos, and interactive graphics, is a game changer. It helps us tell stories in a way that words alone cannot. And it’s like a superpower for making complex stuff simple. And hitting you right in the feels.</p>
      <p>Plus, it’s great for grabbing the attention of folks who don’t have the patience for long reads. It helps us reach a broader and more diverse audience. But there’s also a flipside—visual journalism can sometimes go all in on the sensational and eye-catching stuff at the expense of real substance. It’s like someone’s chasing clicks and views at any cost.</p>
      <p><strong>Voiceover:</strong> It’s a balancing act of course, very important. The digital age has thrown us into a world of social media and citizen journalism. News outlets are here not only to convey information but also to unravel the intricacies and nuances of events. So how are traditional journalists adapting to the visual trends?</p>
      <p><strong>Zou:</strong> Most importantly, we are adapting by maintaining our roles as observers, investigators, and storytellers.</p>
      <p>Well, we’ve joined the social media party years ago, and short videos have become our jam now. Things are moving faster than ever. Digital platforms are both news sources and reporting channels. It’s a global stage. But it’s also a battlefield—for fact-checking and separating the truth from the tall tales.</p>
      <p><strong>Voiceover:</strong> It’s like a whole new game out there, and it’s a fine line to walk. How do traditional journalists use the implementation of visualisation tools in their work?</p>
      <p><strong>Zou:</strong> You know, visualisation tools are like our secret weapons. We have noted that some issues of global interest usually involve a large number of data, statistics and historical context, which are difficult for the average reader to fully understand. For me, the main thing I can do as a journalist is to present this data in a more accessible and engaging way by integrating visualisation tools, such as interactive maps, charts, and infographics, which help us break down the complexity of the world into a compelling story.</p>
      <p>The combination of visualisation tools not only improves the quality of our reporting, but also broadens our audience. It allows us to reach a wider range of people, including those who may not have a deep geopolitical background, creating a more comprehensive, informative, and compelling news experience for our readers.</p>
      <p><strong>Voiceover:</strong> That’s really fascinating reporting. [Background music] Thanks to Zou for giving us a taste of the magic of combining traditional journalism with popular visualisation. Thanks for tuning in, and until next time!</p>

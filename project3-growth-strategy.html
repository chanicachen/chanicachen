<h2>The Overview</h2>

<p>Education is one of Australia’s largest and most prosperous industries. In 2022–23 Australia’s education and training industry had revenues of around AUD $144.8B, with an estimated total of 5.98 million students across all levels from preschool to tertiary education. The education industry also employs 8.4% of Australia’s workforce, which supports its world-class education system that attracts students from all around the world to many of its prestigious educational institutions, including 42 universities across Australia.</p>

<p style="font-size: 14px; color: #777; font-style: italic;">Summary table of Australian Secondary certificate enrolments</p>



<p>IBDP is an increasingly popular alternative to mainstream curriculum in Australia. In Melbourne alone, 18.4% of high demand catchments are directed toward IB World Schools offering the IB Programmes. There are currently 5,800 IBDP schools around the world and it is globally recognised.</p>



<h2>Enrolment Growth Trends</h2>

<p><strong>Growth:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Non-award courses and microcredential students saw the largest increase in enrolment with a 32.7% increase from 2022 (12,000 → 16,000 students)</li>

<li>Bachelor degrees saw the 2nd largest decline in enrolment from 2022 with a 1.6% drop</li>

</ul>



<h2>Summary of Tertiary Education in Australia</h2>

<p>These statistics are provided by the Department of Education for the 2023 year. Tertiary education enrolments in 2023 were at 1.6 million students. There are approximately 70k lecturers and tutors employed across Australia, with more non-teaching students and academia available to work with.</p>

<h2>The Objective</h2>

<p>Below are possible reasons that Every Minute Media could consider expanding its offering to include IB Diploma tutoring services.</p>



<ol>

<li><strong>Potential for new students</strong>

<ul>

<li>Demand from IBDP students can come from any country since it is international.</li>

<li>As such, Every Minute Media will not be restricted by the “lack of demand” in its location.</li>

<li>There are also 2 exam sessions in every year: May and November for both hemispheres. This provides additional student opportunities.</li>

<li>In 2023 alone, approximately 200,000 students completed the diploma, while QCE in Queensland had only 25,000. A visual comparison can be seen in the figure below.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Subject compatibility</strong>

<ul>

<li>The IB also requires all students to complete a “Group 3” humanities subject. Economics and Business Management are the most popular choices in 2023, and they are both the client’s specialties (International Baccalaureate Organization, 2024).</li>

<li>In November 2023 session, 20,266 students participated in the exams.</li>

<li>Economics had 6,277 enrolments, while Business Management had 7,100 — respectively the second and highest enrolments in humanities subjects.</li>

<li>This is 1/3 of the entire cohort.</li>

<li>This gives the client considerable potential demand if they choose to tutor in these subjects.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ol>



<img src="images/project3-ib-vs-state.png" alt="IB vs State System Enrolment Comparison">

<p style="font-size: 14px; color: #777; font-style: italic;">Comparison of student enrolment numbers (VCAA, 2023) (QCAA, 2023) (NESA, 2023)</p>



<h2>The Process</h2>

<p>Our clients have done around 10 interviews at the early research stage to better understand the needs and goals of their typical users, and our team was able to create a user profile based on their early findings. The client’s current platform of choice to gather students and organise classes is <strong>Superprof</strong>.</p>



<h3>Current problems with Superprof:</h3>

<ul>

<li>Cannot attach files in chat box with students</li>

<li>Cannot link with other communication tools e.g., email</li>

<li>Have to use separate platform for payments e.g., Square</li>

</ul>



<h3>Client’s platform needs:</h3>

<ul>

<li>Advertise himself</li>

<li>Scout students</li>

<li>Efficient communication before lesson starts</li>

<li>Scheduling/cancelling lessons</li>

<li>Integrated payment</li>

<li>Automatic payroll generation</li>

<li>Allows sharing of learning materials</li>

</ul>



<h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>

<p>Preliminary research on possible websites was conducted. The following table shows a comparison of their features:</p>

<img src="images/project3-platforms-comparison.png" alt="Online tutoring platforms comparison">

<p style="font-size: 14px; color: #777; font-style: italic;">Online tutoring platforms comparison</p>



<p>Based on the evaluation of features mentioned in Online tutoring platforms comparison, it seems that no single website is capable to combine all the desired features.</p>

<p>Based on the comparison, we could narrow down the scope, which we recommend a combination of <strong>Canvas LMS</strong> and <strong>Teachworks</strong> in the business to deliver the desired solution.</p>



<p>By leveraging Canvas LMS for tutoring operations such as running classes, uploading materials, etc., students can also access external links within the website to access recordings, online discussions and online tutors. Currently 12 out of 42 universities in Australia use this system. Since this is about 30%, one third of the students would be already familiar with the system.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, Teachworks is convenient for performing administrative duties such as tutor payrolls, billing and finding new clients.</p>



<h3>1) Canvas LMS</h3>

</ul>



<h2>Market Collaboration</h2>



<h3>1) Collaboration with Secondary Schools</h3>

<p>There is a large potential for growth in tutoring students who are in the process of obtaining their secondary school leaving certificates. Of these, the most prominent industry with the most potential for growth is the IBDP, where demand is not currently being met by an adequate supply of tutors.</p>

<p>Every Minute Media could collaborate with secondary schools by contacting the coordinators and offering to provide students with tutoring services. This is a practical way to expand their business, as such collaborations could build credibility and benefit future student recruitment opportunities both nationally and internationally.</p>

<img src="images/project3-ib-schools.png" alt="Popular IB Schools in Melbourne">

<p style="font-size: 14px; color: #777; font-style: italic;">Summary chart of popular IB schools in Melbourne.</p>



<h3>2) Collaboration with Regional and Disadvantaged Schools</h3>

<p>By collaborating with regional and disadvantaged secondary schools, Every Minute Media can offer online tutoring to students who may otherwise lack access to such opportunities due to their current situations. This would be especially useful in remote areas experiencing teacher shortages or in communities rebuilding their education systems after natural disasters.</p>

<p>According to the 2022 Teacher Supply and Demand Report published by the Victorian Department of Education, there were clear trends of secondary school teacher shortages. The highest vacancy levels were in Hume/Moreland (9.9 vacancies per 10 staff), while Goulburn and Outer Gippsland had the highest vacancies in regional areas (9.3 and 9.2 per 10 staff respectively). Outer regional areas on average had 1.1 more vacancies per 10 staff compared to metropolitan schools.</p>

<p>By leveraging its online platform, Every Minute Media can help close this gap by providing support for both regional and disadvantaged metropolitan students.</p>



<h3>3) Collaboration with Organizations, Foundations, and Charities</h3>

<p>Collaborating with non-profits allows Every Minute Media to both support those in need and expand the reach of its services. By offering support through free tutoring or donations, the business can create social impact while also developing its brand identity and values.</p>



<h4>1. Australian Schools Plus</h4>

<img src="images/project3-schoolsplus.png" alt="Australian Schools Plus">

<p><strong>Australian Schools Plus</strong> is a national non-profit that offers services to bridge the divide in educational opportunity and outcomes caused by disadvantage.</p>

<ul>

<li>First Nations Education</li>

<li>Rural, Regional, and Remote Education</li>

<li>Crisis-affected areas and communities recovering from natural disasters</li>

</ul>

<p>Every Minute Media can discuss partnership opportunities directly with Schools Plus, offering tutoring services or financial support aligned with the organization’s goals.</p>



<h4>2. Country Education Foundation of Australia</h4>

<img src="images/project3-cef.png" alt="Country Education Foundation">

<p><strong>CEF</strong> supports rural and regional students by helping them access resources and services to pursue tertiary education and future opportunities. Every Minute Media could support students in meeting their academic goals and even prepare them for university by offering access to mentoring from university staff and alumni.</p>



<h2>Recommendations</h2>



<h3>1) Alternative Websites</h3>

<p>The client has voiced dissatisfaction with the current platform <strong>Superprof</strong> for attracting new students. Research shows that the following platforms offer similar services but with more refined search capabilities:</p>



<h4>Spires</h4>

<img src="images/project3-spires.png" alt="Spires Screenshot">

<p>Functions are mostly similar to Superprof. However, the search function for parents is more detailed, including fields such as course of study, desired teaching time, desired price, and service description.</p>



<h4>Preply</h4>

<img src="images/project3-preply.png" alt="Preply Screenshot">

<p>Preply also has functions similar to Superprof. Its enhanced search specificity increases the likelihood of being seen by parents with specific tutoring demands.</p>



<h3>2) Adjustments to the Website</h3>

<p>Besides platform alternatives, we recommend refining the content on Every Minute Media's own website to improve its search ranking and visibility on Google.</p>

<p>One inspiration is the website <a href="https://www.ibgeographytutoring.com" target="_blank">IB Geography Tutoring</a>, run by a UK-based international school teacher. It often ranks 6th on Google when searching for “IB geography tutoring.”</p>



<p><strong>Insights from IB Geography Tutoring:</strong></p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Use targeted keywords:</strong> The terms “IB,” “Geography,” and “Tuition” directly match high-demand search phrases. EMM can apply this by focusing the site on specific subjects they tutor in.</li>

<li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> The site only includes a personal intro, teaching experience, example work, mode of delivery, and a contact form—making navigation easier for parents. EMM can replicate this clarity and usability.</li>

</ol>
